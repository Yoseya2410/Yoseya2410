- ðŸ‘‹  I am Yoseya, a wild developer who runs naked in the code jungle, mainly researching the mystical techniques of how to make computers willingly work for me.
- ðŸŒ±  Starting from 2019, I have been studying and delving into the Hello World summoning technique. In 2022, I suddenly awakened my dual personality - using JavaScript to build Lego on web pages during the day, and using C language and circuit boards to say encrypted love words at night.  From then on, I happily parkour in the cyber world.
- ðŸ’ž Mathematics and physics are my left and right protectors, nature is my first aid oxygen cylinder when I write bugs, as for learning computer science?  Just the daily soap opera of "love and compile errors" between me and my machines.  
- ðŸ“«  If your imagination is bigger than my code vulnerability, welcome all kinds of heroes and heroes to email and hook up yoseya2410@outlook.com
